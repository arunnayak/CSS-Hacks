CSS Voodoo - The dark art of CSS Hacks
======================================

CSS Hacks are something one doesn't talk about in the public. Developers are ashamed of using them. They are bad, they are evil and you really shouldn't use them at all...
...but sometimes there's simply no other way - and then you sell your soul to the hack-devil...

In my Demo I have Paragraphs containing the names of the targeted Browsers and hide them by default.
Then I use the Browser specific Hacks to make the Browser names visible again.
